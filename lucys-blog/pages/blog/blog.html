    <section>
    <p class="content-text"><strong id="title">Blog</strong><br><br><br>

        Here I write about my most recent projects after having gone through the What if I Say Yes process. <br><br>
        This is my space to inspire you to create your own space after having said yes! to your creative soul.<br><br><br><br>

        <strong>1.	My photography</strong><br><br>
        
            On December of 2020 I started taking photographs during my daily walks outside. It was my way of processing my stress after several months of being at home because of the pandemic. Taking photos made me observe more closely what nature has to offer. I started seeing in a way I hadn't done before. I was taking my time to breath, process and enjoy life by looking at and being with nature.<br><br>

            And then one day I thought, what if I start sharing my photos with the people I love? And not only that. I wanted to create a playful experience and so I decided to send my photos with a special caption.
            <br><br>
            In this blog you will see what I have been seeing since that time and will be able to read the captions I came up with. 
            <br><br>
            I hope to inspire you to start seeing your world from a different lens… one that is more attentive, patient, loving and understanding. 
            <br><br>
            If you do that, I can assure you will start feeling better about your own life.
            <br><br><br><br>

       <strong>2.	My pocast</strong>
        <br><br>
            One day, meditating aloud with my husband and daughter about the meaning of my life, and answering their questions, I concluded that I wanted to try something new that made me very nervous but at the same time excited me enormously: to create my own podcast.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to the pandemic, I had started listening to many podcasts and had fallen in love with this intimate form of communication.
            <br><br>
            Now the question was ... and what do I make my podcast about? What do I have to offer to the world?
            <br><br>
            Ah, it turns out that for many years I have been gifting words to my family, to my dear friends, to people I want to pamper. But I have not published those writings, I have not shared them with anyone other than the people to whom they are dedicated.
            <br><br>
            So, I thought "what if I do it about gifts and words?"
            <br><br>
            Thus, the title, the idea and my podcast were born.
            <br><br>
            The logo was designed for me by my twin brother. My oldest brother is the sound director. My sister-in-law helped me train my voice. And my daughter recorded the podcast presentation.
            <br><br>
            My mother tongue is Spanish and that is why I record it in Spanish. I still haven't gotten myself into saying what if I say yes to recording it in English? because that still scares me (my pronunciation isn't perfect and I'm afraid I will end up saying something that sounds like something else, ha ha). But in the spirit of this website, one day I will be announcing that I now present my podcast in English.
            <br><br>
            In the meantime, I will write here about what I talk about in my various episodes, with every intention of inspiring you to do the same: learn to give away your own words and who knows? Maybe also create your own podcast.
            <br><br><br><br>
            
        <strong>3.	My book with my twin brother</strong>
        
        <br><br>
            My twin brother and I turned 50 this summer (2021) and to celebrate in a big way it occurred to me that we could create a book together and publish it through Amazon. Without editorials involved and without depending on someone telling us if they liked our project or not.
            <br><br>
            I consulted with my brother, and he said yes (See? He paid attention to the process of "what if I say yes?")
            <br><br>
            Many years ago, Jorge found in painting a way to fall in love again with life and with his being, after having gone through very painful moments. And since then, he has created works of art that make those who see them fall in love.
            <br><br>
            And if that wasn't enough, a few years ago he created his own website to promote Mexican artists (you must visit www.pintoresmexicanos.com to see what I'm talking about ... it's a beauty!)
            <br><br>
            Well, our idea is to choose his best 50 works of art (painting, drawing and sculpture) and combine them with my best 50 photographs ... but since I have not yet completed a year of starting taking photos and I want to register the change of the 4 seasons of the place where I live, we are going to wait for December 13 to arrive (which is also Saint Lucia's day, that is, my patron saint) and then we will begin the process.
            <br><br>
            Jorge will design the book and I will write the text and together we will publish in 2022 a work that I hope you like as much as we already do.
            <br><br>
            The idea is to inspire you to do the same: self-publishing is a way to bring out our most sincere and deepest thoughts and share them with the world.
            <br><br>
            Here I will tell you about our creative process and update you on our progress ...
            <br><br><br><br>
        
        <strong>4.	My daughter’s projects with me</strong>
            
        <br><br>
            One of the positive effects of the pandemic was that I found new ways to get close to my daughter. Being together all day, all week, all month and for several months was a challenge ... until one day we discovered that we could create things together.
            <br><br>
            In the summer of 2021, several of her cousins were going to graduate from junior high and high school and to celebrate from a distance we made a video with a very important character in Maya's life: Cookies.
            <br><br>
            It is a teddy bear that my brother Héctor gave her the day she was born. He came to the hospital and brought a pink plastic bracelet that said "It’s a girl!" and a beautiful teddy bear that Maya later baptized as Cookies (yes, like that, in plural).
            <br><br>
            The video was so successful that we decided to continue making and sharing Cookies videos to celebrate someone's birthday or to entertain little friends.
            <br><br>
            In this space we will share some of the videos that we have created together (Maya, Cookies and me).
            <br><br>
            I hope it inspires you to create visual projects and share them with the world.
            <br><br><br><br>
        
           
        <strong>5.	My sister’s advice</strong>
            
        <br><br>
            The most important woman in my life, after my mother, is my sister Rocío.
            <br><br>
            She is older than me and therefore has had to open the path so that when I have to go through, life is less difficult for me.
            <br><br>
            She takes care of me from a distance, loves me unconditionally and has taught me to live life in a lighter way.
            <br><br>
            When I have had difficult moments, it is she who I consult.
            <br><br>
            And just as there is the famous Dear Abby column (Dear Abby - Wikipedia), on this site I want to create a similar section but with my sister being the one who gives advice and guides readers, just as she has advised and guided me.
            <br><br>
            This space is intended to be a fun place to listen, learn, and consider a new perspective.
            <br><br>
            Rocío and I hope you enjoy it.
            <br><br><br><br>
        
        
        <strong> 6.	My mom’s recommendations</strong>   

        <br><br>
            My mom dedicated much of her life to raising 3 sons and 2 daughters, and then helping raise her 3 granddaughters and 3 grandsons. The time she had left for herself was minimal and yet she always found a way to keep her curiosity for learning.
            <br><br>
            Now that we are no longer living at her home and she can enjoy her time more freely, she has a huge collection of recommendations on books, movies, documentaries, places, etc.
            <br><br>
            In this space I want to share her recommendations with you, to honor all that institutional memory that she has built in her more than 70 trips around the sun.
            <br><br>
            Hopefully this space will encourage you to turn to the people you have spent a lifetime with and engage in conversations about the things they have learned in the course of their lives.
            <br><br><br><br>

            <strong>7.	Moment of the Week</strong>
            
        <br><br>
            My daughter Maya and my husband Carlos will be in charge of this section. 
            <br><br>
            They wanted to participate in my website, and I said yes :)
            <br><br>
            Here they are going to talk about a moment of the week that was important, fun, interesting, curious, etc., for them.
            <br><br>
            It is a space to encourage you to reflect on how you lived the past week and to choose a moment that you want to remember forever.
            <br><br>
            Maya and Carlos hope you like it.
            <br><br><br><br>
        
        
        <strong>8.	The What if I Say Yes Person of the Month</strong>
            
        <br><br>
            Here I want to share with you the stories of the people I have met who perfectly exemplify what I mean by the "What if I Say Yes!" philosophy.
            <br><br>
            You will meet men and women who, at different times in their lives, have dared to say yes! and have started very interesting projects.
            <br><br>
            They are the people who inspire me to keep going and the ones who remind me that life is worth living.
            <br><br>
            I hope this space inspires you to express the best of yourself in the different areas of your interest.
            <br><br>
            Good luck!
