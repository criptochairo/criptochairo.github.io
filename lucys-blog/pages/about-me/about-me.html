    <section>
        <p class="content-text"><strong id="title">About me</strong><br><br><br>


            My name is Lucía Cárdenas.<br><br>

            I am a daughter, sister, wife, mom, aunt, niece, goddaughter, friend, comadre, partner, guide, supporter, coach, virtual cheerleader, Zoom session organizer, archivist at heart, writer, podcaster and much more.<br><br>

            I have a Bachelor's degree in General Education from UNAM, a Master's degree in Anthropology from the New School for Social Research, and a Certificate in Translation from English into Spanish from the now called University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV).<br><br>

            But most importantly, I am the intellectual creator of this website that honors the philosophy that defined the life of my dear brother: Héctor Cárdenas. A philosophy that speaks of possibilities, of growth, of love of life, of using yes constructively and creatively.<br><br>

            I welcome you to this sanctuary of possibilities!<br><br>

            Let me tell you why I created this space ...<br><br>

            Héctor was the one who taught me to take risks and to throw myself into doing things that scared me but that at the same time I really wanted to do. <br><br>

            Thanks to him I decided to leave my country and pursue a graduate degree in the US, and thanks to him my life trajectory gave a radical turn that has taken me to where I am today.<br><br>

            Whenever I came up with new ideas, he always encouraged me to try, to do whatever I had to do to make my dreams come true.<br><br>

            When he died (unexpectedly in the summer of 2016) his absence left us all with a very deep hole in our souls.<br><br>

            But over the years, in addition to missing him greatly, I have learned to incorporate things into my life from what I learned from his. That is my way of not letting him go, of not forgetting him, of making his absence hurt less.<br><br>

            So one day, after 5 years of him being gone, I woke up with an idea: What if I bought the domain with the phrase that he used in English for the text he wrote to a friend when he dedicated one of his paintings to her: What If I Say Yes?<br><br>

            I immediately got down to work. I went to Google, saw that the domain I wanted was available, and bought it. Then I started to think about what I wanted to achieve with this space.<br><br>

            I also remembered that my nephew Luis is studying programming and I hired him to design this website.<br><br>

            Then I asked my twin brother to design the logo and it ended up being a collaboration between him and my daughter Maya.<br><br>

            One day, before Héctor died, I had put on my vision board that I wanted to publish a book with my 3 brothers and my sister. But that plan died with Héctor’s passing.<br><br>

            So then decided that this was the space to do it but it would now include my closest family members (not only my siblings).<br><br>

            This is the project that I imagined one day, before Héctor’s passing, but now it’s bigger and has a different meaning.<br><br>

            This is the place where I dialogue with my family to process, indirectly, our pain for his absence and where we all honor his life and what he left in the soul of each one of the human beings with whom he came across in his almost 49 years of walking on this Earth.<br><br><br><br>

            This space is in your honor, dearest brother!<br><strong>WE LOVE YOU!</strong>
